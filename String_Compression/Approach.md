Problem:
Print character and their occurrence



If there is single occurrence, add the alphabet only and not the number
If occurrence is greater than 1 and less than 10, add alphabet and then number of occurrence
If occurrence is greater than 10, push the occurrence as different characters eg: if occurrence is 12: add this as '1', '2'
