Problem Statement:
Find the maximum number of flowers that can be planted

There would be 3 cases for this:

Case 1: Empty spaces before first already planted flowers
Case 2: Empty spaces between already planted flowers.
Case 3: Empty spaces after last already planted flowers.

Total number of flowers that can be planted would be equal to sum of flowers that can be planted under these 3 cases.
